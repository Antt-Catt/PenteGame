# Pente game
This project was made during my last year of "classe pr√©paratoire" before I entered engineering school.

We developed in a group of 3 students a client/server game called [Pente](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pente) in Python thanks to the [PodSixNet](https://github.com/chr15m/PodSixNet/tree/master) lib.

The graphic interface was designed thanks to the [Tkinter](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.12/Lib/tkinter) lib.

The server was able to support multiple games at a time, in a tournament. Players were winning or losing points if they won or lost.
